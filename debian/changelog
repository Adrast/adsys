  * Add a new status command, returning current user connected, mode, last
    refresh time and applied configuration
  * Add a new doc command, which allows listing the documentation or write a
    specific chapter on the terminal or disk.
  * Add a new debus hidden (system) command, which allows dumping
    adsys-gpolist and (in the future) various multiple debugging tools for a
    specific AD setup
  * Advance CI completion for users, machines and other contextual strings
    (requesting the service for available valid items, based on context).
  * Hook up CI to update online documentation (on github) and local offline
    one in two ways (updating the local doc will update the online one and
    vice-versa)
  * Write the whole documentation for setting up and using adsys
  * Refactor configuration handling and const location
  * Only start machine GPO download on boot (blocking) if we have AD configured
  * Fix pam integration by setting correct linker property
  * Fallback to sssd discovery active AD server
  * Fix GDM dconf keys to use for screen customization
  * New adsysservice to properly shutdown authorizer and move service dbus
    handling
  * Integrate gosec to CI and multiple fixes
  * Serialize adsys-gpolist and admx/adml in binary
  * Misc fixes in listing Active Directory GPO, multiple error cases
    graceful handling and fix some Windows requirements like spec names.
  * Small fixes and error message reformulation
  * Update all dependencies to latest version and hook up Dependabot in CI
  * Multiple CI enhancements
  * Fix for admx generation, allowing pointing at keys not present in a
    release if filtered out
  * Tighten build and package depdencies.
  * Tests:
    - add more configuration for integration tests
    - fix protobuf namespace conflicts
    - multiple refactoring
    - ensure local dbus are properly shutdown
    - fix some racy tests but being more relax on times
    - allow coverage for python code and subprocesses
    - add many new tests, including integration tests
    - replace wharthogs.biz domain by example.com. Thanks Paul Mars
